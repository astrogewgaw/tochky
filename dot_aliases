# A few aliases:
#   1. Alias `exit` to `x`.
#   2. Alias `nvim` to `vim`.
#   3. Alias `clear` to `cls`.
#   4. Alias `chezmoi` to `cz`, since I use it a lot.
#   5. Alias `. ranger` to `rn`, since it is my file manager and
#      adding a dot just before it ensures that it changes to the
#      directory that I navigate to. Also, takes care of a issue
#      that does not allow it to open any of text files since `sh`
#      cannot seem to find my Neovim binary.
#   6. Add an alias that changes to my hard disk as the current
#      working directory, since the actual path to my hard disk
#      is way too long.
#   7. Add an alias for `ssh`, since I am using kitty, and weird
#      things happen during any remote login if I don't do this.
#      Note that this is also recommended by the author fo kitty
#      himself.
#   8. Alias another commonly used kitten (plugins for the kitty
#      terminal) that can show images: `icat`.
#   9. An alias for `pywal`, that by default points to the ever
#      expanding directory where I store my desktop wallpapers
#      by default.
#   10. Get a progress bar and time estimate when copying files,
#      thanks to the wonderful `rsync` utility.

# A few more aliases, this time focusing on the `ls` command.
# I always end up replacing the default, featureless `ls` with
# the much more powerful `exa`, so I alias the most used combos
# in almost any shell I am in.
